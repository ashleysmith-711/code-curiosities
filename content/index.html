			<p>"Ashley was a great part of my team at Evernote! We were on the same team for about a year, but we worked
				on neighboring teams for a couple more. Ashley is a detail-oriented front-end developer, who works
				closely with designers to deliver new features. She has a great habit of asking questions early and
				often, to get insight into tricky bugs or figure out a plan for a feature. Senior engineers on our team
				really enjoyed working with her because of this! Ashley was often willing to collaborate with other
				developers to tackle issues. I really appreciated the time that we overlapped on a team!"</p>

			<p>"Ashley is hands-down the hardest working and most brilliant engineer I've had the pleasure of working
				with at Hello World, a K12 computer science program. She holds herself and her work to an incredibly
				high standard and always produces work that exceeds expectations. She invests herself fully in whatever
				project she's working on and will go through great lengths to ensure she's providing the best technical
				and curricular support she is capable of. She's also kind, thoughtful, and a fun person to have on our
				team. I consider her to be a true culture leader of many talents and any organization or team would be
				incredibly lucky to win her over! "</p>
