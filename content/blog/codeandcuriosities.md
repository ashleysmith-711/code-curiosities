## The Why of Creating Code & Curiosities

In late May 2023, for the first in my 6.5 year software engineering career, I found myself unemployed. My initial job search in 2016 only lasted 3 weeks after a bootcamp graduation, I was very fortunate that vAuto took a chance on me when the most interesting project on my resume was an online version of Rock Paper Scissors called Bear Princess Cowboy. I met the recruiter at an in-person hiring event, nailed the technical interviews and proved to be an excellent fit on the team for 3 happy years. When I discovered the opportunity at Evernote, my experience at vAuto and interview skills was enough to land me an offer.
