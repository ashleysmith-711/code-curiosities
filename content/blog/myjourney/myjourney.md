## Education

In college at UC Berkeley, my focus leaned more towards cultivating friendships, crafting costumes, and plotting my next travel escapade rather than charting a clear career path. My affinity for people, a knack for essay writing, and the class times of sociology courses naturally led me to a Sociology degree. Four years flew by, and as I held that hard-earned diploma, I realized for the first time in my life I had no answer to the big question: "What comes next?"

A year of soul-searching followed, serving pizzas at Zachary's Pizza in Oakland and savoring the freedom that came with youth and few responsibilities. Yet, an undercurrent of restlessness nudged me toward change, and I moved home to Stockton, CA. Working at my mom's print shop, I honed my craft as a graphic designer. The job of assembling yearbooks for local sports teams and connecting with the community through design was fulfilling. It's a chapter I hold dear, as the skills I cultivated there often intertwine with both my personal and professional endeavors—be it crafting UI mockups or designing playful awards for my softball team.

## Coding a new Chapter

I once believed computer science was the realm of mathematical prodigies and tech enthusiasts, but through a series of fortunate events I discovered that the tech world also values creative, sociable, and logical minds—minds like mine.

In 2015, my sister Megan, a fresh business graduate, veered into the tech world by attending a coding bootcamp in San Francisco. "If Megan can do it, why can't I?" - The thought was a seed that rapidly grew roots. I moved to Austin, TX, and spent long hours every day sipping on a Moonraker at Summermoon Coffee (*the best coffee shop ever in my humble opinion!*), reading a JavaScript textbooks and practicing coding. Not long after I attended the [Hack Reactor](https://www.galvanize.com/explore-hack-reactor-coding-bootcamps) bootcamp myself, and found the immersive 13 week experience to be completely transformative.

Nobody can become an expert coder in 13 weeks, however along with the preparation I did beforehand I had everything I needed to jump into the world of software engineering. I was accustomed to racking my brain learning new coding concepts, my resume showcased several full-stack projects which was enough to get me a few interviews, and I nailed my first two technical onsite interviews thanks to rigorous practicing of data structures and algorithms. The result was 2 offers within 3 weeks of my Hack Reactor graduation, and I was thrilled to sign on as a Software Engineer for vAuto.

## Life as a Software Engineer

Entering vAuto’s doors, I stepped into a wonderland of creativity and innovation. The games and social events weren't just perks; they were the glue that bonded us as a team, fueling our understanding of each other, our users, and the drive to excel professionally. As part of the Stockwave application team, I found my rhythm, marrying my design instincts with robust coding to enhance our software's usability. The mentorship from senior developers didn't just sharpen my technical acumen—it instilled a philosophy of lifelong learning, the value of clean code, and the art of constructive feedback.

At Evernote, my role took a deep dive into complex systems revolving around the rich text editor, where each problem was a puzzle that demanded a tailored solution. It was here that I refined my problem-solving skills, untangling intricate issues with persistence and a collaborative spirit.

Yumi's work felt like a playground for my front-end expertise. During my tenure, I streamlined the codebase and spearheaded the website's revamp. Though my journey there was brief, it underscored my passion and aptitude for front-end challenges.

Now, I'm taking a moment to breathe, enriching my life with the joys of parenthood and the thrill of continuous learning. Stay tuned as I unfold the next chapter of my journey in tech—a tale of code, curiosity, and the constant pursuit of growth.
