        "quote": "Ashley was a great part of my team at Evernote! We were on the same team for about a year, but we worked on neighboring teams for a couple more. Ashley is a detail-oriented front-end developer, who works closely with designers to deliver new features. She has a great habit of asking questions early and often, to get insight into tricky bugs or figure out a plan for a feature. Senior engineers on our team really enjoyed working with her because of this! Ashley was often willing to collaborate with other developers to tackle issues. I really appreciated the time that we overlapped on a team!",

        "quote": "Ashley is hands-down the hardest working and most brilliant engineer I've had the pleasure of working with at Hello World, a K12 computer science program. She holds herself and her work to an incredibly high standard and always produces work that exceeds expectations. She invests herself fully in whatever project she's working on and will go through great lengths to ensure she's providing the best technical and curricular support she is capable of. She's also kind, thoughtful, and a fun person to have on our team. I consider her to be a true culture leader of many talents and any organization or team would be incredibly lucky to win her over!",
